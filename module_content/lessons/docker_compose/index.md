# Docker Compose Explained
docker-compose is a command-line tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Here's how to start, stop, and bring down services using docker-compose:
## Commands 
docker-compose up: This command starts the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. By default, the command runs in the foreground and displays logs for each service in the console.

docker-compose down: This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose up. The services and their data will be destroyed.

docker-compose stop: This command stops the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file, but the containers, networks, and volumes are not removed. The services can be started again later with docker-compose up.

Note that docker-compose works with the concept of services, not individual containers. When you run docker-compose up, docker-compose creates containers for each service defined in the docker-compose.yml file. When you run docker-compose down or docker-compose stop, docker-compose stops and removes (or just stops) all containers created for the services defined in the file.
